//MARK: INHERITANCE -> When one class inherits from another, the inheriting class is known as a subclass, and the class it inherits from is known as its superclass.

//MARK: Overriding
//A subclass can provide its own custom implementation of an instance method, type method, instance property, type property, or subscript that it would otherwise inherit from a superclass.

//Prevents Overriding with FINAL
