# Swift Code Different

is a guide to learn how to program in swift language.

## Importance
To create an app, it is necessary to know the language in its primitive form, without using a framework, because from it, you will be able to use it in the best way and when to use it, for example:

* Struct x Class
* Protocols
* Error Handling

Knowing better, it is possible to create decoupled, safe and reusable code.
